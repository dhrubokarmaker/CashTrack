# Expense Tracker

Here is a full-stack expense tracking application. I built a responsive React front-end and an optimized REST API using Express. Also, implemented and integrated a MongoDB database to model and organize user transaction logs.  
  
Currently, I have not completed the deployment of this project therefore you can try it locally.  
First and foremost, create a config.env file inside config folder using this template:  
```zsh
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 4000
MONGO_URI = <your mongodb uri>
```
Run the following commands on project directory:  
```zsh
cd client
npm install
cd ..
npm install
npm run dev
```
